# Task 1 Odd Even Number
The provided Python code is designed to determine whether a number entered by the user is even or odd. It begins by using the input() function to prompt the user to "Enter a number," and the input is then converted from a string to an integer using the int() function, storing the result in the variable a. The program then uses an if statement to check if the number is divisible by 2, which is done using the modulo operator %. If a % 2 equals 0, this means the number has no remainder when divided by 2, and it is classified as even. In this case, the program prints a message stating that the number is even. If the condition is not met, the program executes the else block, printing that the number is odd. This code effectively demonstrates the use of user input, type conversion, conditional logic, and basic arithmetic in Python.

# Task 2 Sum 1 to 50 by for loop
The given Python code calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a simple for loop. It begins by initializing a variable k to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum. The for loop then iterates through each number in the range from 1 to 50 (inclusive). On each iteration, the current value of i is added to k, effectively accumulating the total sum as the loop progresses. After the loop finishes, the final value of k contains the complete sum of all integers from 1 to 50. Finally, the program prints out the result using the print() function, displaying the message: "The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is:", followed by the calculated sum.
